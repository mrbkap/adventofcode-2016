See the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) web site for more information.

As with [last year](https://github.com/mrbkap/adventofcode-2015), I'm using this
as an excuse to get more comfortable with the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Any mistakes or anti-patterns are my own fault.
